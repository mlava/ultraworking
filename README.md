Start an Ultraworking session and manage it from within Roam Research.

Based on the Ultraworking Work Cycles you can find at https://www.ultraworking.com/twg

Launch a session by using Command Palette and selecting "Start Ultraworking session". Or, use a SmartBlock or SmartBlock button, with the SmartBlock command <%ULTRAWORKING%>.

The extension will display a series of prompts that ask you to plan what you want to achieve, and note a variety of parameters like how your mood and energy are.

Then, a series of prompts will start you on your first work cycle.

Your first cycle will ask you for how long you wish to focus: this is often 30min with a ten minute break, but you can choose what suits you. A small toast will display at the bottom of your graph, showing the duration selected and a progress bar reducing toward zero. When your time is up, you will be prompted to complete a short after-cycle reflection.

After that, the extension will prompt you to either complete another work cycle, or finish your Ultraworking session.
